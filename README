Say hello to my emacs configuration >:] 

While reading my setup, beware of : 
 * I'm a Dvorak user, that should explain some weird keybindings. 
 * Many emacs defaults bindings are overriden ( http://xahlee.org/emacs/ergonomic_emacs_layout_dvorak_5.3.4.png )
 * I'm a rookie Emacs user 

I borrowed a lot to those setups, thanks to their authors :
